The project is a c# asp.net mvc website with Razor.
There are 10000 people in the list generated randomly

 public List<Person> GeneratePeople()
       
 {
         
   var count = 10000;
            
var people = new List<Person>();
         
Random rnd = new Random();
  

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
            
{
                
             
var person = new Person();
                
person.Name = "Person #" + i.ToString();
                
person.Age = rnd.Next(1, 99);
                
person.height = race.height(person);
                
               
people.Add(person);
            
}

            
return people;
        
}




The following tasks are performed

1.Update the class structure to implement the races Angles,Saxons,Jutes,Asians
2.Calculating the Heght of the person based on formulas below

For Angles ans Saxons, height=(1.5+(Age*0.45))

Fo Jutes,Height=((age*1.6)/2)
For Asians,Height=(1.7+((age+2)*0.23))
3.Update the loop that creates people,so that it randomly creates different races of people.
4.Write a loop to add 1 year to each person's age 

5.Build a webpage that shows dropdown list of races,the page should reload to show all the people in the selected race whose age is even,ordered by age.

6.Build basic API endpoint hat returns Json document with the information
Number of people
Avg,min,max age
count of people in each race
